# QuizDesignerLatest
### by Nicole DiLeo and Shehpar Sohail
## Instructions for opening and running our project, which utilizes UI Widgets and Dialogs from Qt Creator:

- Please follow the instructions at the following link for installing Qt VS tools for Microsoft Visual Studio. For reference, we developed with Qt v6.4.0, and in Visual Studio we used Qt Visual Studio Tools v2.9.1.6: https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/qtvstools-getting-started.html 
- Once you have your code environment setup (We used Visual Studio because it seemed to have the best support for Qt and easiest setup) with the proper extensions/downloads to support Qt, please unzip "QuizDesignerLatest.zip" into your workspace for Visual Studio or the like. In order to properly open the project, please do the following in Visual Studio:
  - File-->Open-->Project/Solution...
  - Navigate to the workspace directory where you extracted "QuizDesignerLatest.zip" to. Click on the file "QuizDesignerLatest.sln", then click "Open".
  - The project should load up in Debug mode. In the Solution Explorer on the left in Visual Studio, right click on "QuizDesignerLatest" towards the top and select     "Build". This should compile the project. If you hit any errors that you are unable to resolve, please reach out to either Nicole or Shehpar.
  - You should be able to run the project now. The first window should pop up, entitled "Quiz Designer". As of now, only the "New" and "Cancel" buttons work properly. The "Open" feature has not yet been implemented. 
  
Again, please reach out to us if you run into any issues and we will be glad to help resolve. Thank you!
